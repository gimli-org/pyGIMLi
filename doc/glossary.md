[BERT](http://www.resistivity.net/)
    Boundless electrical resistivity tomography

[FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/)
    The FEniCSx computing platform.

[GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/)
    The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). Default compiler for most linux systems. The Windows port is {term}`MinGW`

[Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/)
    Gmsh: a three-dimensional finite element mesh generator with built-in pre- and post-processing facilities {cite}`GeuzaineRemacle2009`. See: {py:func}`pygimli.meshtools.mesh.readGmsh`

[IPython](http://ipython.org/)
    An improved {term}`Python` shell that integrates nicely with {term}`Matplotlib`.

[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)
    A Python package displays publication quality results.

[MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
    MinGW, a contraction of "Minimalist GNU for Windows", is a minimalist development environment for native Microsoft Windows applications.

[MSYS](http://www.mingw.org/)
    MSYS, a contraction of "Minimal SYStem", is a Bourne Shell command line interpreter system. Offered as an alternative to Microsoft's cmd.exe, this provides a general purpose command line environment, which is particularly suited to use with MinGW, for porting of many Open Source applications to the MS-Windows platform.

[NumPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/)
    The fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.

[Paraview](http://paraview.org/)
    Is an open-source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization application.

[pyGIMLi](https://www.pygimli.org)
    Geophysical inversion and modelling library.

[Python](https://www.python.org/)
    The programming language that {term}`pyGIMLi` (and our scripts) are
    written in.

[PyVista](https://www.pyvista.org)
    3D plotting and mesh analysis through a streamlined
    interface for the Visualization Toolkit (VTK).

[SciPy](https://scipy.org/about.html)
    Scientific Computing Tools for Python.

[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org)
    A documentation engine written in Python.

[STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_%28file_format%29)
    Unstructured triangulated surface file format native to the "stereolithography" CAD software created by 3D Systems.

[SuiteSparse](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html)
    SuiteSparse is a single archive that contains packages for solving
    large sparse problems using Sparse Cholesky factorization.
